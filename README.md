# Image-Tracing-Demonstration

Experience realistic light behavior in a 2D environment where a point source of light—controlled by the mouse cursor—illuminates the surroundings. Obstacles in the environment cast shadows, dynamically blocking light and creating an interplay of illuminated and dark areas. Additionally, a sprite is placed on the window, with portions of it changing based on visibility from the light source, enhancing the visual realism. Built using C++ and SFML, this program offers an immersive demonstration of how light interacts with opaque objects and dynamically affects its surroundings in a 2D world.
